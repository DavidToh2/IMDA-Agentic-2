Jenny Lee (born 1972) is a Singaporean venture capitalist and Senior Managing Partner of Granite Asia based in Singapore. Lee was the first woman venture capitalist to break into the top 10 of Forbes Midas List in 2015.

A ST Engineering scholar, she studied engineering at Cornell University in New York from 1991 to 1995 and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and Science and a Master of Science. Upon her return, she joined ST Aerospace as a jet engineer.

In 2001, she obtained a Master of Business Administration from the Kellogg School of Management in Chicago. It was her two-year stint at Kellogg that opened her eyes to a different career path.

Seeing the US stock market boomed and then busted in 2001 and how the capital markets affected everyone, it made her realised "the big world outside and she wanted to get out there and learn some more."

In 2001, she returned to Singapore.

She found a job with Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong. A year later, she joined Japanese venture-capital firm, JAFCO Asia.

In 2005, she joined GGV Capital as a managing partner and was involved in setting up GGV presence in China. While working with GGV, the firm invested in startups such as Alibaba, Didi Chuxing, Xiaomi, Toutiao, and Grab.

In March 2024, Lee and Jixun Foo led the newly formed firm, Granite Asia after it was split off from GGV Capital.
